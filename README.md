## 🌟 Project Overview
This project aims to identify fake profiles in social networks using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various profile attributes and behavioral patterns to classify profiles as genuine or fake with high accuracy.

## ✨ Features
- Multiple ML models for fake profile detection
- Web-based interface for easy interaction
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results and model performance
- Gender prediction from names
- Profile analysis with detailed insights

## 🤖 Algorithms Used
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble learning method
   - Handles non-linear data well
   - Provides feature importance

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Effective in high-dimensional spaces
   - Good for binary classification
   - Handles non-linear decision boundaries

3. **Neural Network**
   - Deep learning approach
   - Can capture complex patterns
   - Requires more computational resources

## 📊 Data
### Dataset Description
The project uses two main datasets:
1. **Genuine Users** (`users.csv`): Contains features of real user profiles
2. **Fake Users** (`fusers.csv`): Contains features of fake user profiles

### Features
- Profile attributes (name, age, gender, etc.)
- Activity metrics
- Network characteristics
- Profile completeness
- And other relevant features

## 🌐 Web Application
A Flask-based web interface is provided for easy interaction with the models. The web app allows users to:
- Input profile details
- Get real-time predictions
- View confidence scores
- Access model explanations

## 📈 Results
Model performance metrics and visualizations are available in the `html/` and `pdf/` directories, including:
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Precision-Recall curves
- Feature importance plots
